        <p>Hardware used in website development
To run and develop websites hardware like keyboards, computers, mouses and monitors are important. Keyboards, mouses, monitors and other peripherals are important for web development because they allow us to interact with the computer and write code. The computer is the most important piece of equipment which runs all of the code and software that is needed to run and develop websites. In a computer the CPU is responsible for the thousands of instructions used to compute website software.
RAM in a computer holds the software instructions and data needed by the processor and works very closely with the cpu. RAM is very important for loading data from websites. Hard drives In computers are responsible for reading and writing data. Hard drives are important for reading and writing data on a web server to host websites and generate the website's component files. 
Software used in website development

Website development involves a variety of software tools that serve different purposes.
The two main types of web development are the front end and back end.
The front end of web development constructs the web page that the user will interact with. Software used for the front end include HTML, javascript and css. HTML is used for structuring a web page. CSS is used for styling a web page which includes changing colours, adding backgrounds, images and many more things to make html look nice. Javascript is a coding language which works with html to give a website interactivity like animations, popup menus, clickable buttons and more.  

Another Software that is heavily used in website development is the code editor.A code editor is a crucial software tool in website development, aiding developers in writing precise code for websites. It provides syntax highlighting, error detection, and code formatting. Similar to a well-organised workspace, a code editor streamlines the process, resulting in efficient and error-free website development.
