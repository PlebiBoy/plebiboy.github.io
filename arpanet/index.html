    <h1>ARPANET to WWW: History of the Internet</h1>
    <p>It's undeniable that the internet have become an integral part of our lives, but where did it all begin? What is the difference between
        the World Wide Web and the internet? What is ARPANET? What is HTML? All this and more will be explained in a timeline of the roots of
        the internet to where we are today.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>1969: ARPANET</h3>
    <p>Before the internet, there were several competing networks which would eventually lay 
        the foundation to what we have today. One of these was ARPANET, of which the first computers 
        would be connected in 1969. It was an early adopter of technology that forms the basis of the 
        internet, for example packet switching, a staple of modern internet infrastructure.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>1979: TCP/IP</h3>
    <p>TCP/IP, or the Internet protocol suite, is now a combination of several protocols, the 
        Internet Protocol (IP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). 
        However when it was established in 1974 it was made up of only TCP. In 1983 this technology was 
        adopted by ARPANET, as a year earlier it was declared the standard for military computer networking
        by the US Department of Defense. The widespread adoption of TCP/IP was essential for the creation 
        of the Internet, as it allowed the existing networks to intercommunicate and merge.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>1986: NSFNET</h3>
    <p>The NSFNET was created in 1986 to connect supercomputing centres funded by the 
        National Science Foundation. It included TCP/IP in its initial deployment, 
        allowing interconnection with ARPANET and others, leading to it becoming the principal internet 
        backbone. Access was initially limited to the government and universities, 
        however restrictions were removed in 1991 so it could compete in the newly emerging Internet 
        service provider market, which had been formed 2 years earlier by the first commercial ISPs 
        who provided direct access to the Internet for the public.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>1991: The World Wide Web</h3>
    <p>The WWW's origins are found in 1989, when Tim Berners-Lee submitted a memorandum to CERN on 
        information management, where he conceptualised a "hypertext" system where one could read a 
        document, and immediately link to any of the references via clicking on a link. He worked on 
        three technologies for this: a uniform resource locator (URL) which would be a unique 
        identifier to locate a resource, HyperText Markup Language (HTML) which would be the publishing 
        language for WWW pages and the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) which would allow for the 
        transmission of hypertext documents, or what we now know as webpages. In January of 1991 the 
        first web servers outside of CERN were activated, and over the next few years new browsers for 
        rendering hypertext and organisations to create open standards for the emerging technology 
        would form, giving us the World Wide Web which is crucial to today's internet. 
        Although the internet clearly includes other technologies than the WWW, nowadays the two terms 
        are often interchanged in casual conversation.</p>
