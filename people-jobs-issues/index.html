    <h1>Evolution of Cybersecurity: From People to Jobs and Beyond</h1>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <h3>
        Early Cybersecurity Landscape: Exploring People, Jobs, and Emerging
        Issues
      </h3>
      <p>
        The domain of cybersecurity has undergone a sweeping evolution over the
        course of several decades. In the formative two decades that followed
        the inception of computers, executing cyber attacks was a formidable
        challenge. During this phase, the concept of hacking was primarily
        confined to phone phreaking, eventually evolving to encompass computer
        system breaches.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Pioneering Hackers: From Disruption to Sophistication</h3>
      <p>
        In the nascent stages, hackers primarily sought to cause disruptions
        without harboring malicious intent, often without any financial
        motivation. Nonetheless, by 1967, the landscape of hacking had evolved,
        birthing swifter and more intricate methodologies that laid the
        groundwork for the concept of cybersecurity.

      <h3>Birth of Cybersecurity Professions: The ARPANET Catalyst</h3>
      <p>
        The 1970s marked the advent of cybersecurity as a pivotal profession,
        catalyzed by the emergence of ARPANET. This nascent network laid the
        foundation for the critical role that cybersecurity professionals would
        play in safeguarding digital spaces.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Internet Expansion and Escalating Cybersecurity Needs</h3>
      <p>
        With the 1990s witnessing an exponential surge in internet usage, the
        demand for robust cybersecurity measures surged in parallel. The influx
        of users brought about a corresponding increase in viruses and online
        threats, necessitating heightened efforts to fortify the digital
        landscape.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        New Millennium Challenges: Connectivity, Breaches, and Compromises
      </h3>
      <p>
        As the 21st century dawned, households across the globe became
        irrevocably connected to the internet. However, this era also bore
        witness to unsettling episodes of widespread credit card breaches and a
        proliferation of hacking endeavors driven by both financial and
        political ambitions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>A Watershed Moment: Sony's Network Breach</h3>
      <p>
        In 2011, the cybersecurity landscape experienced a watershed moment as
        Sony's network fell victim to a significant breach. Millions of
        PlayStation users' personal information was compromised, resulting in an
        unprecedented shutdown of Sony's network.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        A Glimpse into the Bigger Picture: Cybersecurity's Continuing Evolution
      </h3>
      <p>
        This overview of cybersecurity's history only scratches the surface.
        Hackers are relentless in their evolution, constantly devising
        innovative strategies to overcome security barriers. As technology
        continues to advance, the landscape of online privacy and security
        remains in a constant state of flux, underscoring the ongoing battle to
        safeguard our digital existence.
