    <h1>Project Design</h1>
    <h2>Identify the target audience, key features of the webpage and the brainstorming processes behind these decisions.</h2>
    <p>The target audience of our website would could be gamers of various ages who are interested in reading reviews, insights, and discussions about different video games. This audience might include casual gamers, hardcore gamers, and even parents looking for information about suitable games for their children.</p>

    <h2>Main Features of Website</h2>

    <h3>Navigation Bar:</h3>
    <p>The navigation bar is the backbone of your game review website, serving as a roadmap that guides users through various sections and content. This feature ensures a seamless browsing experience, allowing visitors to quickly access the information they're interested in. Your navigation bar should be strategically designed to be intuitive, user-friendly, and reflective of your site's content structure.</p>

    <h3>Contrast Between Text and Image Links:</h3>
    <p>Creating a contrast between text and image links is a valuable design decision that can enhance the accessibility and visual appeal of your website. This contrast ensures that all users, including those with visual impairments, can easily identify and interact with clickable elements. It also adds a layer of interactivity and engagement to your site's visuals.</p>

    <h2>Main Styling Features of Website</h2>
    
    <h3>1. White Space:</h3>
    <p>Within our website design philosophy, we deeply appreciate the significance of white space. Referred to as negative space, white space defines the unoccupied areas surrounding elements on a webpage. Aligning with the timeless adage "less is more," this principle holds a special place at PixelPerfectRatings. Our commitment to this notion is evident in our meticulous approach to design.
      <br><br>
      When crafting our styles in CSS, we consistently prioritize incorporating margins around objects. This practice harmonizes with our belief in the power of simplicity and organized spacing. Moreover, we rigorously test our webpage across various screen sizes, ranging from monitors to laptops and phones. This thorough evaluation guarantees that the content remains effortlessly readable, regardless of the device used.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="space"><strong>The intrinsic value of white space lies in its multifaceted advantages:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Enhanced Readability: By leveraging white space, we sidestep the pitfalls of content clutter. This results in an environment where users can seamlessly read and assimilate information, thereby enhancing their overall experience.</li>
      <li>Visual Segmentation: White space serves as a visual compass, guiding users through distinct sections of our content. This meticulous separation cultivates clarity, indicating transitions between different topics and lending a sense of structure to the webpage.</li>
    </ul></div>

    <h3>2. Drop-Down Menus:</h3>
    <p>This website employs an intuitive drop-down menu system, seamlessly extending the navigation bar to encompass the essential web links required for smooth navigation. Moreover, pages like "About the Internet" and "Game Review" feature well-organized information presented alongside image links, elevating the overall navigation experience.</p>

    <h3>3. Font</h3>
    <p>In designing our website, we've opted for accessibility-focused fonts like Helvetica. This choice significantly improves readability, particularly for diverse audiences such as parents. By using Helvetica, a font known for its clarity, we ensure that all age groups can easily engage with our content. This decision reflects our commitment to enhancing user experience by making information more comprehensible to everyone.</p>

    <h3>4. Colour</h3>
    <p>Colour holds immense significance in shaping a website's impact. Our design philosophy steers clear of the harsh black background and white text combo, which can strain eyes. Instead, we've curated a palette of inviting, vibrant colours, coupled with a unique black purplish font. These colours—pink, purple, and red—convey nuanced themes: Fun, Power, and Change. This symbolism parallels the dynamic world of technology and gaming, where evolution is constant. Through this colour scheme, we infuse a personal essence into our reviews, fostering a deeper connection and elevating user experience.</p>
