      <h2>Game: BeamNG.drive</h2>
      <div>A Sandbox of Automotive Mayhem</div>
      <div>Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)</div>
      <p>
        BeamNG.drive is a more realistic addition to the vehicle and sandbox
        simulation genres, offering players an unparalleled freedom experience
        in the world of vehicular physics and destruction. Developed by BeamNG
        GmbH, this game diverges from traditional racing-oriented simulations
        and instead places emphasis on the realistic simulation of vehicle
        dynamics and collisions. It's not your typical racing game, but rather a
        virtual automotive playground that allows players to experiment with
        countless scenarios and experience the joys and devastations of
        vehicular interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core of BeamNG.drive's appeal lies in its remarkably detailed and
        advanced physics engine. Every vehicle in the game behaves with a sense
        of realism that is unmatched in the genre. Whether you're trying to
        navigate a tight corner, perform a power slide, or engage in a
        high-speed collision, the physics engine accurately captures the nuances
        of vehicle movement, weight distribution, and deformation. This opens up
        a world of possibilities for players who enjoy testing the limits of
        vehicle behaviour.
      </p>
      <img width="700px" height="400px" src="images/beamng2.jpg" />
      <p>
        One of the standout features is the game's "Soft-body Physics," which
        simulates the deformation of vehicles in a dynamic and responsive
        manner. Crashes and collisions look and feel shockingly realistic,
        making each accident an engrossing spectacle in its own right. The
        damage model and the way cars crumple and break apart are particularly
        impressive, giving players a chance to witness the chaos of automotive
        destruction up close.
      </p>
      <p>
        While BeamNG.drive doesn't offer traditional racing circuits or
        structured campaigns, it makes up for this by providing an extensive set
        of user-created scenarios and a robust vehicle customization system. The
        game is essentially a sandbox, and players can construct their own
        challenges, scenarios, and environments, fostering creativity and
        experimentation. The modding community is vibrant, and there's a steady
        stream of user-generated content that ranges from elaborate obstacle
        courses to intricate recreations of real-world locations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Graphically, BeamNG.drive presents a mix of strengths and weaknesses.
        The vehicles themselves are detailed and well-designed, showcasing an
        impressive level of realism. Environments, on the other hand, can
        sometimes lack the same level of detail and polish. The lighting and
        weather effects contribute to the overall visual appeal, but they may
        not be at the cutting edge of modern gaming visuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The audio design is solid, with engine sounds that match the behaviour
        of the vehicles accurately. The crunching of metal and the shattering of
        glass during collisions add an immersive layer to the overall
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        BeamNG.drive caters to a specific niche of gamers who are intrigued by
        the physics and mechanics of vehicles, as well as those who enjoy
        creative experimentation and the art of vehicular destruction. While it
        lacks traditional racing elements, it compensates with unparalleled
        attention to detail in its physics simulation. The game's sandbox nature
        and robust modding community ensure that its longevity remains intact,
        as new content continues to be created by the community. If you're
        seeking a different kind of driving experience that focuses on the
        intricacies of vehicle dynamics and the thrill of chaotic collisions,
        BeamNG.drive is well worth a spin.

      <p>
        Explanation of Jbeam: JBeam is the underlying framework in BeamNG.drive
        that simulates soft body physics. It represents vehicles as
        interconnected nodes and beams, allowing for realistic deformation and
        interaction. Here's a concise explanation of how it works:
      </p>
      <img width="700px" height="400px" src="images/beamng3.png" />
      <p>
        Nodes and Beams: The vehicle's structure is divided into nodes (points
        in space) and beams (connectors between nodes). Nodes are like the
        corners of a 3D mesh, and beams are the lines connecting them. These
        nodes and beams form the flexible structure of the vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Physics Simulation: When external forces like collisions, acceleration,
        or braking are applied to the vehicle, the nodes and beams respond
        accordingly. Beams can stretch, compress, and bend, while nodes move in
        response to the applied forces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stress and Deformation: Each beam has properties like length, stiffness,
        and strength. These properties determine how much stress a beam can
        handle before it deforms or breaks. Deformation happens gradually,
        affecting neighbouring nodes and beams, creating a realistic crumpling
        effect during collisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Realism and Complexity: The JBeam system accounts for factors like
        material properties, collision points, and forces acting on the vehicle.
        The interplay of these elements creates complex deformations that mimic
        real-world physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flexibility and Diversity: JBeam allows for a wide range of vehicles,
        from sturdy trucks to delicate cars, each with different deformations
        based on their structures and properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Performance Considerations: Achieving real-time soft body physics
        involves a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.
        Complex interactions can strain computer resources, so game developers
        optimise JBeam to provide a balance between realism and smooth gameplay.
      </p>
      <p>
        In essence, JBeam's soft body physics goes beyond traditional rigid body
        simulations, offering a more lifelike representation of vehicle
        behaviour and damage. It's a core aspect of what sets BeamNG.drive apart
        and contributes to the game's unique focus on vehicular dynamics and
        collisions.
