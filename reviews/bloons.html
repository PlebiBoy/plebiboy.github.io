    <h1>Bloons Tower Defense 4</h1>
    <div class="g-r-text">
    <div>Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)</div>
    <img width=700px height=300px src="images/td4-2.jpg">
    <p>Bloons Tower Defence 4 (BTD4) is a true gem in the tower defence genre, a game that captured the hearts of players around the world with its strategic gameplay, charming graphics, and addictive challenge.

      Originally released in 2009, BTD4 remains a legendary title that stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of well-designed tower defence games. 
      </p>
    <p>Gameplay (5/5): BTD4's gameplay is where it truly shines. The core mechanics are simple to grasp, yet the game's escalating difficulty and strategic depth make it incredibly engaging. The goal is to pop waves of colourful balloons (bloons) by strategically placing different types of towers along the path to prevent them from reaching the end. The variety of tower types is impressive, each with unique abilities and upgrades. From dart monkeys to cannons, ice towers to boomerangs, players have a plethora of options to experiment with and customise their defence strategy. This variety encourages players to adapt and strategize according to the bloon types and levels they're facing, adding an extra layer of depth to the gameplay. </p>
    <p>Graphics and Sound (4.5/5): BTD4's visuals might not be cutting-edge by today's standards, but they still possess a timeless charm. The vibrant colours, cute animations, and distinctive bloon designs contribute to a visually appealing experience. The game's graphics are optimised for the genre, keeping the focus on the strategic elements rather than flashy effects. The sound design complements the gameplay well, with cheerful sound effects for popping bloons and satisfying upgrade sounds. The music, while enjoyable, can become repetitive over time. Nonetheless, the overall audio-visual package enhances the game's accessibility and enjoyment. </p>
    <img width=300px height=300px src="images/td4-3.jpg">
    <p>Content and Replayability (4.5/5): BTD4 offers a wealth of content to keep players engaged. With various levels of difficulty, challenges, and modes, there's always something new to explore. The inclusion of special missions and free-play mode adds longevity, while players can strive to complete all the different achievements and unlock upgrades, keeping the replayability high. </p>
    <p>Multiplayer (4/5): BTD4's multiplayer aspect adds another layer of excitement. While the game does offer multiplayer options, the lack of online play in the original version might be a drawback for players seeking competitive online matches. However, local multiplayer still provides an enjoyable way to team up with friends and tackle bloon waves together. </p>
    <p>Conclusion: Bloons Tower Defense 4 has earned its legendary status within the tower defence genre. Its addictive gameplay, diverse tower options, and appealing visuals continue to captivate players, even years after its initial release. While it may lack some modern conveniences and online multiplayer features, BTD4's solid mechanics and enduring charm make it a must-play for tower defence enthusiasts and gamers alike. Whether you're new to the genre or a tower defence veteran, BTD4 offers an enjoyable and strategic gaming experience that will keep you coming back for more balloon-popping fun.
